Please send us a first draft of your chapter by *1 August 2022*. The editors will read drafts and send comments on *1 September 2022*. Final drafts are then due on *31 October 2022*. 

The chapters should be presented according to the Taylor & Francis Group (Routledge) manuscript guidelines: https://www.routledge.com/our-customers/authors/publishing-guidelines.

Please find below excerpts which are relevant to chapter presentation, but refer to the complete guidelines if needed.

We cannot accept manuscripts that do not adhere to these guidelines, so please follow them carefully. We are open to answering any questions you may have! 


## Author guidelines

### General
The chapter should be sent as a Microsoft Word or Open Office document. 

Please do:
* Use a Unicode font, such as Arial or Times New Roman
* Number the pages of yur chapter - center
* Add a line between paragraphs and avoid indents at the start of a paragraphs 

Please keep in mind that all *references, notes, and bibliographies or reference lists are included in the agreed word count.*

### Stylistic guidelines, referencing and bibliography
We will be using the *Chicago Manual of Style* for notes, citations, and bibliography. More information is available at: https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html


### Non-textual elements
Please DO NOT include in the document anything that isn’t text. This includes: 
* Figures (artwork, photos, diagrams, graphs, etc.) 
* Maps 
* Boxes 
* Equations (unless fully editable in Word) 

These items should _not_ be pasted or embedded in the chapter text files, but rather submitted separately. 

These non-text items should, however, be described in the text using captions (and alternative text) and referred to clearly and consistently via callouts to indicate their inclusion and placement. This also applies to structured text that is included in the chapter, for example tables and boxes. 

Name each item according type, chapter, and order within chapter, for example: Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2, Figure 2.1. Figure 2.2, Figure 2.3 etc. The item numbers should match the file names for each item exactly.


### Callouts 
Any item that needs to be inserted into the text needs a callout – a short, easily identifiable piece of text to indicate roughly where the item should be placed. The callout should match the naming of the item’s file name exactly and should be highlighted to make it stand out. For example: 

<Figure 2.3 here>

Note that our standard text designs place any figures, tables, and boxes at the top or bottom of a page, as near to the callout as possible, but not necessarily in the exact location indicated. 

When referring to non-text items, always be specific, for example “see figure 2.3” rather than “see the below figure,” as the image may have been shifted slightly during typesetting. 


### Captions 
Images and tables require a caption briefly describing the content. 

Captions may also include any necessary source information such as who took a photograph, who provided some artwork, or where some data is from. Providers of this material may require a specific credit line as part of the permission to use that content, which can be included in the caption (or wherever the provider has requested). 

Here is an example caption: 

Figure 2.3. A dog running along a beach. Photograph by the author. 

Captions should be inserted directly below the callout (or the table) for that item. 


### Tables 
Tables must be supplied in an editable format. Images of tables from other sources must be rekeyed. Please use the table functionality in Microsoft Word or Open Office and avoid using tabs and line breaks to construct the appearance of a table (which is prone to shift and become unintelligible during copyediting and typesetting). Larger, data heavy tables can be created in Microsoft Excel (though consider how well they will fit in a book). 

Editable tables should be included directly in the chapter text file. Tables must follow the naming, numbering and caption conventions laid out above. 


### Boxes 
Boxes can be used to isolate and highlight segments of text, perhaps for a definition or case study. To indicate that a segment of text should be boxed, add appropriate tags, e.g. <start box> and <end box>

Floating boxes are positioned and numbered in the same way as a figure or table, with a caption, e.g. Box 1.1, Box 1.2 etc. 

Submitting non-texutal items (images, maps, etc)


### Spelling
Please use US spelling
